This program is intended for use at my workplace, for Operators who are opening or closing lots.
When an Operator is ready to close a lot, they can click on "Change Lot" and the program asks if they are sure 
the item number on the new DHR matches the item number on the old DHR.  If they are not sure, it will warn them 
that that could mean that there's a difference in material or packaging and to check their DHRs before proceeding.  
If they select "Yes" to the question, they will continue to the Forms in our localized Hyperlink.  
This code does not link to the actual Hyperlink that we will use at work.

The second button is "Close Lot" and this is intended for when an order closes.  When they select it, they are asked
if there is any heldware in their current order that needs to be remade.  If the answer is "Yes" then they are asked to 
see a Quality Tech before closing the current order.  If the answer is "No" then the program will continue to the 
Forms page in our localized Hyperlink.  This code does not link to the actual Hyperlink that we will use at work.

The last button is for Feedback.  When they select this button, it takes them to a new page where they can enter and
view their Feedback.
